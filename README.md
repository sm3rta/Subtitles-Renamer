# Subtitles-Renamer
A script that renames subtitles by the videos in the same folder, for video players to automatically detect them.

You have a folder containing 10 episodes of your favorite series and their subtitles, and you're fed up with dragging the subtitle into the video player each time, this script renames every subtitle to the appropriate video files.

The video files and the subtitle files must be in the same order (the script is not an oracle)
