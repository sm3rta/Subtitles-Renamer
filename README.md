# Subtitles-Renamer
A script that renames subtitles according to the videos in the same folder, for video players to automatically detect them.

Say you have a folder containing 10 episodes of your favorite series and their subtitles, and you're fed up with dragging the subtitle into the video player each time, this script renames every subtitle as the appropriate video file.

No more dragging and dropping!
Disclaimer: the video files and the subtitle files must be in the same order (this script is not an oracle, probably you won't have to worry about this but make sure the renaming process was successful, if not, you can undo it easily).
